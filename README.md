4. Add a button that will count each word in the input box.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Bootstrap4 framework - Used this to save time creating a UI without
hard coding raw html & css so I can focus on the project's logic.

2. PHP - Used this to create dynamic content for brandname, currentpage & footer.
Also used it to include one file (site-info.php).

3. Javascript(jQuery) - Used this to avoid page refresh to improve app speed for
users & also reduce the amount of code required to complete the project.

4. CSS - Used this for sticky footer and footer linkd.
